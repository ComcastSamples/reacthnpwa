        You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a
        mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder.
        After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don\t know
        exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us
        survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath,
        that Im breaking now. We said wed say it was the snow that killed the
        other two, but it wasnt. Nature is lethal but it doesnt hold a candle to
        man.

        Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but
        you happen to pull this shit while Im in a transitional period so I dont
        wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I cant give you this case, it dont
        belong to me. Besides, Ive already been through too much shit this
        morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That shows called
        a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on
        the strength of that one show they decide if theyre going to make more
        shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some dont,
        become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
