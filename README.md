# Introduction to Web Components via Shared Components

### Hello! :wave:

Thanks for coming to our hands-on introduction to Web Components & Polymer! If you stumbled onto this and weren't at the event, hopefully this is still of somewhat use :-)

This is a sample react app to show integration of Web Components.

# HNPWA
Hacker News PWA with react - Hosted version https://reacthnsuriel.firebaseapp.com/

## Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:ComcastSamples/reacthnpwa.git  
cd reacthnpwa  
npm install  
npm start  
```

Make sure you have the shared components setup from https://github.com/ComcastSamples/wc-components
